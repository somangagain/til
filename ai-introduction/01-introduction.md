## 1-artificial intelligence

**Artificial intelligence is a problem solver**, not a machine that thinks like a human.



## 2-fields and their scopes

artificial intelligence > machine learning > deep learning

- **artificial intelligence**(learn, decision-making, problem-solving)
- **machine learning**(learn from data, **improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed**)
- **deep learning**(**uses multi-layered artificial neural networks** to model complex patterns in **big data**)



## 3-brief history

#### **1943–1956: The Birth of AI**

- **1950** – **Alan Turing, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"**
  - **"Can machines think?"**
  - Introduces the **Turing Test** – a test to determine whether a machine can engage in a conversation indistinguishable from that of a human.
- **1956** – **John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon** organize the **Dartmouth Conference**
  - The term **"Artificial Intelligence"** is coined by John McCarthy.
  - This conference is considered the official birth of AI as a field of study. The goal was to explore how machines could simulate aspects of human intelligence.

#### **1956–1974: Early Research and Development**

- **1958** – **Frank Rosenblatt, "The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain"**
  - Introduces the **Perceptron**, a **probabilistic model for how the brain stores and organizes information** (inspired by neurons).
  - The **single-layer neural network** that **takes input signals, applies weights to them, and produces an output through an activation function**.
- **1969** – **Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, "Perceptrons"**
  - **Critiques the Perceptron**, showing its limitations, particularly in solving non-linear problems like the XOR problem.
  - This leads to a **temporary decline in neural network research**, but the groundwork for future advancements in multi-layer networks is laid.

#### **1974–1980: The AI Winter**

- Due to limitations in early AI approaches and overhyped expectations, AI funding and research suffered a setback. Despite early optimism, many projects failed to meet expectations, and neural networks and other AI methods were sidelined for a time.

------

#### **1980–1990: Expert Systems and Revival**

- **1980s** – **Expert Systems**: AI research shifts focus to **expert systems**, which were designed to simulate the decision-making abilities of a human expert in specific domains.
  - **The rise of symbolic AI** and rule-based systems, such as **MYCIN** (a medical expert system), gained attention during this period.
- **1986** – **Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart, and Ronald Williams** reintroduce **Backpropagation**
  - A key method for training multi-layer neural networks, helping to revitalize interest in **deep learning** and multi-layer networks.

------

#### **1990–2010: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Emergence**

- **1997** – **IBM’s Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov**
  - A milestone in AI development, demonstrating the power of computational brute force and search algorithms.
- **2006** – **Geoffrey Hinton and others** popularize the concept of **Deep Learning**
  - **Deep learning** (using deep neural networks) gains traction as a powerful method for complex pattern recognition tasks such as image and speech recognition.

------

#### **2010–Present: AI Everywhere**

- **2012** – **AlexNet** revolutionizes image recognition, winning the ImageNet competition and marking a turning point in **deep learning** for computer vision.
- **2014** – **Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo** defeats human champions at the game of Go, demonstrating the power of **reinforcement learning** and deep neural networks in highly complex games.
- **2018-2023** – **GPT-3** (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and other large-scale language models push the boundaries of natural language processing, leading to applications such as **chatbots, machine translation, and content generation**.
- **2024 and Beyond** – AI continues to advance in areas like **autonomous vehicles**, **robotics**, **medical diagnostics**, and **artificial general intelligence (AGI)**. Researchers are focused on improving ethical considerations, transparency, and fairness in AI systems.
